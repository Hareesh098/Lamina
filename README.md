\mainpage Lamina: A Molecular Dynamics Package

Welcome to the Lamina documentation!
# Lamina
========================================================================================================================
**Lamina** is a modular 2D molecular dynamics simulation package designed for simulating hybrid soft solids, including 
spring networks and finite-size discs. **Lamina** is a modular and extensible molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package 
written in C, designed to model a wide variety of soft and condensed matter systems. It supports time evolution using 
robust integrators and a range of thermostats, with accurate force evaluations for bonded and non-bonded interactions. 
Originally built for 2D simulations of bonded systems, **Lamina** has grown to support broader research goals including 
active matter, granular solids, and complex fluids.


# Why "Lamina"?
The word **Lamina** comes from Latin, meaning "a thin layer", "a plate", or "a sheet". In nature and science, laminae 
often refer to structural elements that are flat and extended in two dimensions for example, leaves, thin metal sheets, 
or tissue membranes.

This name reflects both the **two-dimensional** (2D) nature of the simulations and the types of materials **Lamina** is 
built to study; **liquids**, **soft solids**, and **networked structures** confined to thin sheets or layers. Just as 
natural laminae exhibit rich structural and dynamic behaviors in a seemingly simple geometry, this code is designed to 
explore the complexity of emergent phenomena in 2D materials and soft matter systems.
